## FRC Team 340 - Greater Rochester Robotics

Greater Rochester Robotics works to promote science, technology, and engineering throughout the Churchville-Chili School District and the greater Rochester area. We incorporate FIRST Robotics concepts into classroom activities, test and design new engineering concepts, and support existing and new FIRST Robotics teams in the region. With the goal of fostering collaboration, Team 340 releases our robot code publicly here in this GitHub organization.

Our robot code for the 2024 season can be found [here](https://github.com/Greater-Rochester-Robotics/Crescendo2024-340).
